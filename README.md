## basic 3D Engine created by Francesc Juille

This project is a basic 3D engine created from stratch without using any thirt party library.
For create the 3D effect the project uses a internal chart with 3 axes (x,y,z).
##
this chart has some objects, each object has vertex, and a vertex only have 3 atributes (x,y,z).
##
For render this 3D chart in 2D I use simple maths: basic trigonometry and basic math functions.
then when we have the 2D version available we provide this data to some library that can render this in the screen,
in my case I use canvas, but you can use other 2D library that you want, or create your own basic way to render 2D data, is very easy.
